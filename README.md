The goal of this project is to use the top, daily news headlines from Reuters to predict the movement of the VIX. The data for this project spans from 2000-01-01 to 2019-01-01 The news from a given day will be used to predict the difference in observed VIX prices over a 24 hour period. This method can also be tweaked for use across any time intervals eg: 10 minutes, 2 minutes etc. 
We will use GloVe to create our word embeddings and CNNs followed by LSTMs to build the neural networks.
